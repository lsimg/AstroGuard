**AstroGuard** is an Edge AI predictive maintenance system designed to detect early-stage anomalies in spacecraft reaction wheels. By analyzing vibration telemetry in real-time, it predicts mechanical failures days before they become critical, preventing mission loss (e.g., Kepler telescope scenario).

##  Key Features

* **Early Anomaly Detection:** Uses an **Autoencoder Neural Network (Unsupervised Learning)** to identify deviations from the "healthy" baseline without needing historical failure data.
* **RUL Prediction:** Calculates **Remaining Useful Life** in hours, allowing engineers to switch to redundant systems safely.
* **Sensor Fusion:** Combines AI-driven trend analysis with **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)** spectral analysis to verify physical defects.
* **Edge-Optimized:** Built with `scikit-learn` for lightweight performance, ready for deployment on onboard satellite computers (OBC) via Docker.
* **Mission Control Dashboard:** A "Houston-style" interface for real-time monitoring of onboard time, health status, and spectral signatures.
 
##  Tech Stack

* **Core:** Python 3.10
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (MLPRegressor / Autoencoder)
* **Signal Processing:** SciPy (FFT, Signal analysis)
* **Visualization & UI:** Streamlit, Matplotlib
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy

##  Project Structure

This repository contains two implementations of the anomaly detection system, demonstrating the transition from research to edge deployment:

### 1. `main.py` (Research Prototype)
* **Engine:** TensorFlow / Keras.
* **Purpose:** Initial research and proof of concept. Uses a Deep Learning Autoencoder to analyze the raw dataset and plot static matplotlib graphs.
* **Note:** Requires `tensorflow` installed manually. Contains hardcoded paths for local testing.

### 2. `app.py` (Production / Edge)
* **Engine:** Scikit-learn (MLPRegressor).
* **Purpose:** Optimized version for embedded systems.
* **Optimization:** We migrated from TensorFlow to Scikit-learn to reduce the model size by **98%** and improve inference speed for onboard satellite hardware (OBC), while maintaining detection accuracy.

##  Data Source

The model was trained and validated using the **NASA IMS Bearing Dataset** (PCoE).
* **Experiment:** Rexnord ZA-2115 bearings subjected to 6000 lbs load at 2000 RPM until failure (35 days test).
* **Source:** [NASA Open Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/ims-bearings) provided by the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS), University of Cincinnati.
